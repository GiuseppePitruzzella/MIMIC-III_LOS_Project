    "\n",
    "To ensure a clean and modular development workflow, this initial code block sets up the necessary environment paths and imports the foundational Python libraries required for data manipulation. The variable `PATH` points to the raw data directory where original MIMIC-III files reside, while `EXPORT_PATH` designates a location for storing intermediate or processed data artifacts, following best practices in reproducible data science workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `export_to_csv()` encapsulates the logic for exporting `pandas` DataFrames to CSV files. Before saving, it performs a check to verify whether the target directory exists, creating it if necessary. This simple yet effective safeguard ensures that any downstream function can persist data without manual folder creation, thus supporting automation and modular execution of the entire data pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of setup, while elementary, is essential for enabling scalable and organized experimentation, especially in the context of complex datasets such as MIMIC-III, where intermediate artifacts are frequently generated during data cleaning, integration, and feature engineering."
