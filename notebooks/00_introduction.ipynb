    "# Supervised Modeling Pipeline for ICU Length of Stay Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Authors**: *Giuseppe Pitruzzella, Radvilė Rušaitė, Karlota Bochanaitė*\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is situated within the field of supervised learning, aiming to predict a continuous clinical variable—**Length of Stay (LOS)** in the Intensive Care Unit—using regression models based on neural networks. The approach aligns with fundamental machine learning paradigms studied during the course, including probabilistic optimization techniques such as Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis uses real-world data from **MIMIC-III** (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care), a publicly available clinical database developed by the MIT Lab for Computational Physiology in collaboration with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Boston). The database contains de-identified health-related data associated with over 60,000 ICU admissions between 2001 and 2012, and has become a globally recognized benchmark for research in medical data science and critical care."
